projects. As a firm believer in open source and copy-left license forms, the source code for
this project can be found here. This repo is the NextJS frontend.

####IMPORTANT

Note though that the repo here is parts of the development
environment and does not necessarily represent the final production version. The code here does not
contain the underlying database, configuration files nor any external code. This repo is only intended
as a subjective example of a Spring based website and as the archive for changes to
the sharp version online.
